# UDP-TCP-Sockets-Forwarding-using-Python
Building a client server model to forward data using UDP Port from server to another using a connecting server in the middle. The client side servers are connecting to the server side servers in round robin approach by performing TCP Checks before sending the data. The solution is fully monitored by logs ingested into splunk.
